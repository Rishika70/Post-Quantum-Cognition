# Post-Quantum-Cognition

### Post-Quantum Cognition (PQCT) â€“ Post-Entanglement AGI

## Overview

Post-Quantum Cognition Theory (PQCT) is a framework for building advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It models cognition as:

- Relational and post-entangled  
- Multi-dimensional: knowledge, emotion, ethics, anticipation  
- Temporally extended and context-aware  

AGI using PQCT can make ethical, adaptive, and anticipatory decisions, while remaining explainable and safe.

## Features

- Cognitive superposition: evaluate multiple potential actions at once  
- Post-entanglement: relational dependencies between cognitive components  
- Collapse operators: select optimal outcomes based on context  
- Feedback loops: self-reflection and learning over time  
- Multi-dimensional embeddings: integrate knowledge, emotion, ethics, and anticipation
